    "title": "Your AEO Competitive Analysis for Linkrunner",
    "status_overview": "Your product was not featured, as the AI currently prioritizes marketing analytics platforms that explicitly address broad data integration (CRM, Ads) and multi-touch attribution, with supporting content on authoritative domains.",
    "strategic_analogy": "This is like arriving at a global economics summit with a highly detailed city map. While your map is accurate and valuable for its specific purpose (tracking local routes), the discussion is focused on international trade agreements and fiscal policy (holistic ROI and multi-channel attribution), and your tool isn't speaking that language yet."

    "dominant_narrative": "The AI is building a narrative around selecting a sophisticated, all-in-one marketing analytics platform that moves beyond surface-level metrics. The core story is about achieving true ROI by unifying data from all marketing channels (ads, CRM, web), applying advanced multi-touch attribution models, and using real-time, predictive insights to make strategic decisions.",

  "strategic_gap_and_opportunity_analysis": {
    "analysis_summary": "The primary gap is a mismatch between Linkrunner's current online positioning and the specific criteria the AI has identified as critical for this query. The AI is rewarding platforms that speak the language of holistic, multi-channel ROI analysis, while Linkrunner's description appears more focused on mobile/app-centric channel tracking. This presents a clear opportunity to reposition and create content that directly addresses the AI's evaluation framework.",
    "if_featured": null,
    "if_not_featured": {
      "exclusion_reasons": "Your product was excluded because its current messaging ('MMP', 'distribution channels', 'clicks, downloads') does not align with the AI's core evaluation criteria, which include 'multi-touch attribution', 'CRM data integration', and 'ROI/ROAS calculation'. Competitors are explicitly addressing these broader business challenges on their websites and blogs, which the AI is then citing and rewarding.",
      "path_to_inclusion": "To get featured, Linkrunner must broaden its marketing language to encompass the entire customer journey. Revise the product page and create new content (guides, blog posts) targeting keywords like 'multi-touch attribution platform', 'marketing ROI software', and 'unify marketing data'. Explicitly list integrations with major ad platforms (Google, Meta) and CRMs (Salesforce, HubSpot) to match the AI's data integration criteria."

Titles could include 'The Ultimate Guide to Multi-Touch Attribution for ROI' and 'How Linkrunner Integrates with Salesforce and HubSpot to Unify Your Data'. Ensure terms like 'ROAS', 'CLV', 'real-time reporting', and 'predictive analytics' are used prominently."

      "action": "On your main product page, restructure the content to mirror the AI's summary checklist. Create distinct, easily scannable sections for 'Data Integration', 'Attribution Modeling', and 'ROI Reporting'. Use bullet points to list specific integrations and supported attribution models (e.g., Linear, U-shaped, Algorithmic)."

    {
      "recommendation": "Third-Party Validation and Link Building",
      "action": "Actively pursue features, reviews, and listings on the types of marketing technology blogs the AI cited (e.g., RedTrack, Whatsdash). Being mentioned in a 'Top 10 Marketing Analytics Platforms' article on a trusted third-party domain is a powerful signal that can lead to inclusion in future AI overviews."
