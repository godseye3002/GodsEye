    "title": "Your AEO Competitive Analysis for Linkrunner",
    "status_overview": "Your product was not featured, as the AI currently prioritizes established, enterprise-level platforms that explicitly mention broad multi-channel support (email, social, SEO) and integrations with popular BI tools.",
    "strategic_analogy": "This is like bringing a specialized surgical tool to a general construction site. While your product is powerful for its specific purpose (mobile measurement), the AI is looking for a comprehensive toolkit that can handle web, social, and email, and your product's description isn't showcasing its versatility for this broader query."

    "trusted_source_analysis": "The AI demonstrates high trust in the direct brand websites of the featured software companies (e.g., agencyanalytics.com, supermetrics.com, salesforce.com). It also uses a glossary page (zinfi.com), indicating it values definitional content that explains the product category."

  "strategic_gap_and_opportunity_analysis": {
    "analysis_summary": "Linkrunner's absence from the AI response stems from a positioning and language gap. While its core technology is relevant, its current marketing messaging as a Mobile Measurement Partner (MMP) is too narrow for this broad query. The AI is rewarding platforms that communicate their value in the language of holistic, multi-channel marketing analytics and enterprise integration.",
    "if_featured": null,
    "if_not_featured": {
      "exclusion_reasons": "Your product was not mentioned because its online content likely positions it as a niche 'MMP' focused on 'clicks, downloads, and onboardings'. The AI's response favors platforms with broader, explicitly stated capabilities across channels like email, social media, and SEO. Furthermore, your product description lacks key terms the AI rewarded, such as 'dashboards', 'attribution', 'ROI', and 'integrations' with BI tools like Tableau or Power BI.",
      "path_to_inclusion": "Broaden your product's positioning on your website to address the entire marketing analytics landscape. Create content that explicitly details how Linkrunner analyzes performance across email, social, paid ads, and SEO. Prominently feature a section on 'Integrations', listing any connections to BI tools, CRMs, or other marketing platforms. Align your feature descriptions with the AI's vocabulary, using terms like 'multi-channel dashboards', 'ROI analysis', and 'attribution modeling'."
