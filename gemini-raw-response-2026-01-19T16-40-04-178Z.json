    "title": "Your AEO Competitive Analysis for Avyott Talk",
    "status_overview": "Your product was not featured, as the AI currently prioritizes competitors with a strong, discoverable online presence and clearly articulated, specific features like named CRM integrations and enterprise-grade capabilities.",
    "strategic_analogy": "This is like trying to join a panel discussion without an invitation. The AI has identified a list of known speakers (competitors) from their own websites and industry blogs, and your product is currently not on the guest list due to a lack of discoverable, authoritative online content."

    "analysis_summary": "Avyott Talk's exclusion stems from a lack of discoverable online content that details its specific, competitive features and integrations. The AI is rewarding competitors who clearly articulate their value proposition and technical capabilities on their own domains. The opportunity lies in building a content footprint that mirrors the structure and specificity of the featured platforms.",
    "if_featured": null,
    "if_not_featured": {
      "exclusion_reasons": "Your product was not mentioned because its online presence lacks the specific details the AI is rewarding. Key gaps include: 1) A lack of specific, marketable feature descriptions (e.g., competitors use terms like 'no-code workflows' while your features are generic like 'AI Voice Automation'). 2) No mention of critical integrations with CRMs or telephony systems (e.g., Salesforce, Twilio), which the AI identifies as a key industry feature. 3) The AI did not find an authoritative source (like a brand website or blog) to cite for your product's capabilities.",
      "path_to_inclusion": "To get featured, you must build an authoritative online presence. Revise your product pages to detail specific, unique features and create a dedicated 'Integrations' section listing all compatible platforms like Salesforce and Zendesk. Develop blog content that compares Avyott Talk to competitors and explains its value in solving specific customer service problems, mirroring the strategy used by Assembled."

      "recommendation": "Content Structure Enhancement",
      "action": "On your primary product page, implement a clear, scannable structure using H2/H3 tags for 'Key Features', 'Integrations', 'Use Cases', and 'Security & Compliance'. Use bullet points to list capabilities, making the information easily parsable for AI crawlers."
    },
    {
      "recommendation": "Keyword and Claim Alignment",
      "action": "Ensure your marketing copy explicitly mentions integrations with major platforms (e.g., 'Salesforce-ready', 'Twilio integration'). Adopt the specific language competitors are being rewarded for, such as 'end-to-end workflow automation' or 'human-like conversational AI', if they accurately describe your product."
    },
    {
      "recommendation": "Third-Party Validation and Content Strategy",
      "action": "Develop a content marketing strategy that includes product comparisons, case studies, and industry insights, similar to the Assembled blog post cited by the AI. Additionally, pursue listings on major software review platforms like G2 and Capterra to build external trust signals."
