    "strategic_analogy": "This is like being a specialized artisan coffee bean provider at a supermarket where shoppers are only asking for 'instant coffee' or 'espresso pods.' The AI is organizing its answer by broad, familiar categories, and our specialized product isn't being recognized within that framework yet."

  "strategic_gap_and_opportunity_analysis": {
    "analysis_summary": "The primary barrier to inclusion is not a lack of features, but a lack of visibility and categorization within the authoritative third-party sources the AI uses for its knowledge base.

    "if_featured": null,
    "if_not_featured": {
      "exclusion_reasons": "Your product was excluded because it lacks mentions in the high-authority marketing blogs and 'best of' listicles that form the AI's source material. Furthermore, its positioning as a specialized 'MMP' doesn't align with the broad, functional categories (Web Analytics, CRM, SEO) the AI uses to structure its answer, making it difficult for the AI to classify and recommend.",
      "path_to_inclusion": "The most direct path to inclusion is to secure mentions and features on the types of domains the AI trusts (e.g., AgencyAnalytics, Funnel.io, Contentsquare's blog). Additionally, create on-site content (blog posts, comparison pages) that explicitly positions Linkrunner - 2 in relation to the mentioned competitors (e.g., 'A modern alternative to Google Analytics for channel attribution') to help the AI understand your product's place in the market."

      "recommendation": "Strategic Content Creation",
      "action": "Develop a series of on-site articles and comparison pages that frame Linkrunner - 2 against the market leaders mentioned in the AI overview.
