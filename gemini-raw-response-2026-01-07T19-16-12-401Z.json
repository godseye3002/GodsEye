  "strategic_gap_and_opportunity_analysis": {
    "analysis_summary": "Linkrunner's absence is primarily due to a lack of visibility and authority in the third-party sources the AI trusts. The AI's selection process heavily favors established brands with specific, clearly articulated advanced features that are validated by mentions in marketing tech listicles and reviews. Linkrunner's current online footprint and feature descriptions are not aligned with these winning patterns.",
    "if_featured": null,
    "if_not_featured": {
      "exclusion_reasons": "The primary reason for exclusion is the lack of mentions on authoritative third-party marketing tech blogs and review sites, which the AI uses as a primary source for discovering and validating top platforms. Additionally, the product's feature descriptions may lack the specific, technical keywords (e.g., 'multi-touch attribution', 'cookieless tracking') that the AI has identified as critical decision factors for this query.",
      "path_to_inclusion": "The most direct path to inclusion is to secure features, reviews, and listings on the types of marketing technology blogs and software comparison sites cited by the AI (e.g., ShortPen, Visualize Value). Concurrently, enhance on-site content on Linkrunner.io to detail specific features using industry-standard terminology that aligns with what competitors are being rewarded for, such as creating a dedicated page for 'Advanced Attribution Models' or 'Granular Channel Reporting'."

  "actionable_recommendations": [
    {
      "recommendation": "Content Structure Enhancement",
      "action": "On your primary product and feature pages, create dedicated sections with H2/H3 tags for 'Multi-Touch Attribution', 'Granular Channel Reporting', and 'Cookieless Tracking'. Use bullet points and tables to clearly define what each feature does, making it easy for AI to parse and compare against competitors."

      "recommendation": "Keyword and Claim Alignment",
      "action": "Integrate the exact phrases the AI highlights for competitors into your website's copy, such as 'detailed ROI analysis', 'conversion funnel tracking', and 'cross-channel insights'. Frame Linkrunner as a solution for 'performance marketers' and 'growth marketers' to align with the AI's understanding of the target audience."
    },
    {
      "recommendation": "Third-Party Validation Strategy",
      "action": "Initiate a targeted digital PR and outreach campaign to get Linkrunner reviewed and listed on marketing technology blogs, software review platforms like G2/Capterra, and in 'Best Link Tracking Software' articles. Prioritize the domains already cited by the AI in its sources as they are proven to be trusted entities."
