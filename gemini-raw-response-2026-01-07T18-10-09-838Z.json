    "title": "Your AEO Competitive Analysis for Linkrunner",
    "status_overview": "Your product was not featured, as the AI currently prioritizes competitors that explicitly market advanced features like A/B testing, cookieless tracking, and direct ROI attribution, and are mentioned in authoritative third-party marketing blogs.",
    "strategic_analogy": "This is like entering a professional auto race with a reliable family car. While your car is functional and solves a core need (transportation), the judges and audience are rewarding high-performance features like 'turbochargers' (A/B testing) and 'advanced aerodynamics' (cookieless tracking) that competitors are showcasing prominently."

    "dominant_narrative": "The AI is building a narrative that modern link tracking is not just about counting clicks, but about providing a comprehensive marketing intelligence and attribution solution. The story is centered on tools that help marketers prove financial return (ROI/ROAS), navigate privacy changes (cookieless tracking), and optimize campaigns with sophisticated features (A/B testing, fraud detection).",

    "analysis_summary": "Linkrunner's absence from the AI's answers stems from a misalignment between its current marketing language and the specific, feature-rich terminology the AI has identified as critical for this product category.

      "exclusion_reasons": "Your product was excluded because its online content likely lacks the specific keywords the AI prioritizes, such as 'A/B testing,' 'cookieless tracking,' 'server-side tracking,' 'fraud detection,' and 'ROI attribution.' Your features, while valuable ('Onboarding Tracking'), are not framed in the language of campaign optimization and financial return that competitors use effectively. Furthermore, you are likely not featured in the third-party review articles the AI is using as primary sources.",
      "path_to_inclusion": "Revise your website and product pages to explicitly name and describe advanced features that compete with the market leaders. Frame 'Onboarding Tracking' as a tool for measuring post-click conversion and customer lifetime value (LTV).

      "recommendation": "Third-Party Validation Strategy",
      "action": "Develop a strategy to get Linkrunner reviewed or listed on the types of authoritative domains the AI is citing (e.g., marketing software review sites, tech blogs). Feature comparisons like 'Linkrunner vs. ClickMagick' or guest posts on attribution can build the external trust signals the AI is looking for."
