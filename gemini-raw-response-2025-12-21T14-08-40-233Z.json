    "title": "Your AEO Competitive Analysis for Linkrunner",
    "status_overview": "Your product was not featured, as the AI currently prioritizes well-established category leaders (e.g., All-in-One, SEO, Link Management) and your product's specific niche has not yet achieved this level of recognition in the AI's sources.",
    "strategic_analogy": "This is like trying to enter a 'Best Vehicle' competition by presenting a high-performance engine. The judges are awarding prizes for complete vehicles in established categories like 'Best Sedan' or 'Best SUV'. Your product is a powerful component, but it needs to be framed as a complete, category-defining solution to be recognized."

    "analysis_summary": "The primary challenge for Linkrunner is a lack of established authority and clear categorization within the AI's framework. The AI favors well-known brands that are definitive leaders in broad categories.

    "if_featured": null,

      "exclusion_reasons": "Linkrunner was excluded because the AI's response is built around established, broad categories where other tools are already dominant (e.g., HubSpot for 'All-in-one', Bitly for 'Link Management'). Your product's positioning as a 'smarter alternative to Onelink.to' is too niche for this general query and isn't supported by the high-authority third-party sources the AI is referencing.",
      "path_to_inclusion": "To gain inclusion, Linkrunner must establish itself as a leader in a clearly defined sub-category, such as 'Granular Channel Performance Tracking' or 'Marketing Attribution for Growth Marketers'. This requires creating detailed content that directly compares Linkrunner to competitors like Bitly and Cometly on these specific features, and securing mentions on authoritative third-party marketing tech blogs, review sites (like G2), and integration directories."
