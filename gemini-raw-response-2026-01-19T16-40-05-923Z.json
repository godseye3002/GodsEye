  "executive_summary": {
    "title": "Your AEO Competitive Analysis for Avyott Talk",
    "status_overview": "Your product was not featured, as the AI provided a generic 'how-to' guide for evaluating platforms rather than recommending specific vendors. The response outlines key decision criteria which your current online content does not explicitly address.",
    "strategic_analogy": "This is like asking for a list of the best cars and receiving a detailed manual on how to be a car mechanic. The AI is focused on teaching the user *how to choose*, not *what to choose*. To be included, you must prove your product is the perfect application of the principles taught in that manual."
  },
  "client_product_visibility": {
    "status": "Not Featured",
    "details": "The AI's response is a comprehensive guide on how to select a voice AI platform and does not mention any specific products or brands, including Avyott Talk."
  },
  "ai_answer_deconstruction": {
    "dominant_narrative": "The AI is acting as a procurement advisor, creating a detailed buyer's guide for a business user. The narrative focuses on educating the user about the essential technical capabilities, integration requirements, compliance standards, and pricing models to consider when purchasing a voice AI customer service platform, with a specific focus on the Indian market.",
    "key_decision_factors": [
      "Core capabilities (ASR, NLU, TTS)",
      "Deployment models (cloud vs. on-premises)",
      "Integration with CRM and helpdesk systems (Salesforce, Zendesk)",
      "Support for multiple languages, including Indian languages (Kannada, Hindi)",
      "Security and compliance standards (HIPAA, PCI, data residency in India)",
      "Transparent pricing models (per-minute, per-seat)",
      "Scalability and reliability (uptime guarantees)"
    ],
    "trusted_source_analysis": "The AI did not cite any external sources. The response is generated entirely from its internal knowledge base, functioning as a self-contained informational guide. This indicates that for this type of query, the AI is confident in its own ability to synthesize a comprehensive answer without external validation."
  },
  "competitive_landscape_analysis": [],
  "strategic_gap_and_opportunity_analysis": {
    "analysis_summary": "The primary gap is not a failure to compete against mentioned rivals, but a lack of content that aligns with the AI's educational, criteria-based response. The AI has laid out a detailed checklist for what a good platform should have. Avyott Talk's online presence needs to explicitly and comprehensively answer this checklist to be considered a relevant entity for this topic.",
    "if_featured": null,
    "if_not_featured": {
      "exclusion_reasons": "Your product was excluded because the AI's response pattern for this query is to provide a generic evaluation framework, not a list of products. Furthermore, your product's available online data lacks the specific, technical keywords and feature details (e.g., 'ASR', 'NLU', 'Zendesk integration', 'data residency in India') that the AI has identified as critical decision factors.",
      "path_to_inclusion": "Create detailed content on your website that directly maps Avyott Talk's features to the AI's evaluation criteria. Develop dedicated pages or blog posts for 'Integrations', 'Security & Compliance', and 'Supported Languages', using the specific terminology highlighted by the AI. This positions Avyott Talk as a direct solution to the user's implicit questions, making it a prime candidate for inclusion in future, more specific AI-generated answers."

  },
  "actionable_recommendations": [
    {
      "recommendation": "Content Structure Enhancement",
      "action": "On the Avyott Talk product page, create distinct, clearly-labeled sections for 'Core Capabilities', 'Integrations', 'Deployment Options', and 'Security & Compliance'. Use technical terms like 'ASR', 'NLU', and 'TTS' within these sections."
    },
    {
      "recommendation": "Keyword and Claim Alignment",
      "action": "Incorporate the specific criteria and questions from the AI's answer into your marketing copy and FAQs. For example, create a FAQ entry titled 'How does Avyott Talk handle data residency in India?' or 'What CRMs like Salesforce and HubSpot do you integrate with?'"
    },
    {
      "recommendation": "Third-Party Validation Strategy",
      "action": "The AI mentioned specific integrations like Zendesk and Salesforce. Pursue official listings on their marketplaces or partner directories. This creates authoritative, third-party signals that validate your platform's capabilities in a way the AI trusts."
