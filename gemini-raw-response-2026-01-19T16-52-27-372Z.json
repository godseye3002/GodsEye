    "title": "Your AEO Competitive Analysis for Linkrunner",
    "status_overview": "Your product was not featured, as the AI's response exclusively prioritizes all-in-one CRM platforms for 'customer acquisition tracking', overlooking specialized marketing analytics tools.",
    "strategic_analogy": "This is like entering a 'Best Multitool' competition with a high-precision surgical scalpel. While your tool is superior for its specific task (granular analytics), the AI is currently rewarding the Swiss Army knives (CRMs) that claim to do everything."

  "client_product_visibility": {
    "status": "Not Featured",
    "details": "Linkrunner was not mentioned by name or brand in the AI-generated overview or in any of the cited source links. The entire response is focused on CRM software."

  "ai_answer_deconstruction": {
    "dominant_narrative": "The AI is framing the solution to 'customer acquisition tracking' as the adoption of a comprehensive Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform. The narrative suggests that tracking is a core feature within these larger systems, rather than a standalone function. It recommends well-known CRMs and evaluates them based on scalability, integrations, and user-friendliness for different business sizes.",

      "Product Category (CRM)",

    "trusted_source_analysis": "The AI demonstrates high trust in content marketing from direct competitors within the software/CRM space. The sources are blog posts from EngageBay, Freshworks, and Monday.com, which are likely 'best of' or 'alternatives' articles that position their own products while reviewing the landscape. This indicates the AI is heavily influenced by competitor-generated comparison content."

    "analysis_summary": "The core issue is a categorical mismatch. The AI has interpreted the query 'customer acquisition tracking software' as a request for CRM recommendations. Your product, Linkrunner, is a specialized Marketing Analytics Platform/MMP. Because it is not positioned as a CRM, it falls outside the AI's consideration set, which is currently defined by competitor blog content comparing various CRMs.",
    "if_featured": null,
    "if_not_featured": {
      "exclusion_reasons": "Your product was excluded because it is not categorized or described as a CRM. The AI is rewarding platforms that offer an all-in-one suite of sales, marketing, and service tools. Your product's messaging about being an 'MMP' and 'Marketing Analytics Platform' does not align with the CRM-centric narrative the AI has constructed from its sources.",
      "path_to_inclusion": "To get featured, you must bridge this categorical gap. This involves creating content that explicitly targets 'customer acquisition tracking' and either A) positions Linkrunner as a superior, specialized alternative to the tracking features within CRMs, or B) highlights how Linkrunner integrates with and enhances popular CRMs like HubSpot and Salesforce. This content needs to be published on your blog and promoted to gain the authority to be cited by the AI."

      "action": "Update your website copy to incorporate the specific terms the AI is rewarding, such as 'multi-channel attribution', 'funnel analytics', and 'campaign tracking'. Explicitly state how Linkrunner solves these problems, drawing a direct line between the AI's decision factors and your product's features."

      "action": "Pursue placement in third-party software review articles and comparison websites (e.g., G2, Capterra, MarTech Series) under categories related to 'Marketing Analytics', 'Attribution Software', and 'Customer Acquisition'. This builds the external, authoritative signals the AI relies on to discover and trust new solutions."
