    "status_overview": "Your product was not featured, as the AI currently prioritizes established platforms that are explicitly named in authoritative third-party marketing technology blogs and listicles.",
    "strategic_analogy": "This is like trying to get into an exclusive club. The AI is the bouncer, and its guest list is created from trusted sources like WebFX. To get in, you need to be on that list; having a great product isn't enough on its own."

    "dominant_narrative": "The AI is constructing a narrative that provides a curated list of trusted, specialized platforms for marketing ROI measurement. It frames the solution as a choice between different tools, each with a distinct strength, such as being free (Google Analytics), B2B-focused (HockeyStack), or enterprise-grade (Measured).",

    "trusted_source_analysis": "The AI demonstrates high trust in a mix of authoritative third-party content sites that publish 'best of' lists (WebFX, Ruler Analytics' blog) and the direct websites of the platforms themselves (HockeyStack, Measured). This indicates a reliance on both external validation and clear, first-party product marketing."

    "analysis_summary": "The primary gap is not one of product features but of market presence and third-party validation.

Competitors have successfully secured mentions in these key listicles, which acts as a ticket to inclusion.",
      "path_to_inclusion": "The most direct path to inclusion is to secure features and mentions on the same types of authoritative marketing blogs and software review sites that the AI trusts.
