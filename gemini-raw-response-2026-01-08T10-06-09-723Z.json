    "title": "Your AEO Competitive Analysis for Linkrunner - 2",
    "status_overview": "Your product was not featured, as the AI currently prioritizes tools that explicitly market themselves as 'CAC calculators' or have dedicated web content addressing customer acquisition cost tracking, a keyword alignment competitors are successfully leveraging.",
    "strategic_analogy": "This is like being a world-class orchestra in a competition for 'best rock band.' Your platform is powerful and sophisticated, but you're not playing the specific genre the judges are looking for. To win, you need to create a 'rock anthem'—a dedicated page that explicitly showcases your CAC tracking capabilities using the language the AI understands."
