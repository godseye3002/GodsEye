    "title": "Your AEO Competitive Analysis for Linkrunner",
    "status_overview": "Your product was not featured, as the AI's response is educational and conceptual, sourcing its information from competitors' thought leadership content like blogs and guides rather than specific product pages.",
    "strategic_analogy": "This is like a university lecture where the professor is citing academic papers from various authors. Your product is a state-of-the-art lab instrument, but you haven't published the papers that get you cited in the lecture."

Your current online presence appears to be product-focused and lacks the top-of-funnel, thought leadership content that competitors are successfully providing.",

Create blog posts, guides, or whitepapers titled 'How to Optimize Distribution Channels with Analytics' or 'A Guide to Marketing Attribution Models'. This content must explicitly discuss the key concepts the AI values (CAC, ROAS, real-time data, etc.) and frame Linkrunner as a solution within that educational context."
