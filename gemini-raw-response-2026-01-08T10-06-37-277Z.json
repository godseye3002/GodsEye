    "title": "Your AEO Competitive Analysis for Linkrunner - 2",
    "status_overview": "Your product was not featured, as the AI's response prioritizes well-known tools that fit into broad, predefined categories like 'Business Intelligence' or 'Product Analytics' and are frequently cited in third-party 'best of' listicles.",
    "strategic_analogy": "This is like attending a conference with specific tracks for 'Doctors' and 'Engineers'. Your product is a 'Bio-Mechanical Engineer' – highly specialized and valuable – but because it doesn't fit neatly into the main conference tracks, it wasn't given a speaking slot. To get on stage, you need to frame your talk for either the 'Engineer' or 'Doctor' audience."

  "ai_answer_deconstruction": {
    "dominant_narrative": "The AI is acting as a consultant, segmenting the complex analytics market into distinct, solution-oriented categories: 1) Business Intelligence & Visualization for reporting, 2) Product & Customer Behavior for understanding user actions, and 3) Data Preparation for foundational work. It guides the user by matching tool types to specific business needs.",
    "key_decision_factors": [
      "Clear categorization (e.g., Business Intelligence vs. Product Analytics vs. Data Preparation)",

      "Strong brand recognition within these established categories",

      "Ability to serve a distinct role in the data-to-strategy pipeline"
    ],
    "trusted_source_analysis": "The AI demonstrates high trust in content marketing from the analytics industry itself. It heavily cites 'best of' listicles and comparison articles published by competitors (e.g., Statsig, ThoughtSpot, Contentsquare) and industry blogs (e.g., RudderStack). This indicates that being part of the broader industry conversation on third-party sites is a critical factor for inclusion."

  "strategic_gap_and_opportunity_analysis": {
    "analysis_summary": "The primary reason for exclusion is a mismatch between your product's niche positioning ('MMP', 'distribution channel tracking') and the broader categories the AI uses to structure its answer ('Product & Customer Behavior Analytics'). Competitors are winning by either being dominant players in these broad categories or by being featured prominently in the third-party comparison articles the AI relies on for its information.",

    "if_not_featured": {
      "exclusion_reasons": "Your product was not mentioned because its specific value proposition, while relevant, is not framed using the language and categories the AI has prioritized. The AI is looking for terms like 'product analytics', 'user journey mapping', and 'BI', which are not the primary keywords in your product description. Furthermore, you are absent from the competitor-authored 'best of' lists that are heavily influencing the AI's selection.",
      "path_to_inclusion": "To get featured, you must align your product's narrative with the AI's established categories. Reframe your marketing copy to highlight how Linkrunner - 2 serves as a powerful 'Product & Customer Behavior Analytics' platform for understanding acquisition funnels. The most critical step is to pursue a Digital PR and content strategy to get Linkrunner - 2 included in the same types of 'best analytics platforms' articles that the AI is currently citing."
