    "title": "Your AEO Competitive Analysis for Linkrunner",
    "status_overview": "Your product was not featured, as the AI is answering an informational query by citing authoritative educational content. Competitors are currently winning by becoming the primary source for these explanations, not by having their products directly recommended.",
    "strategic_analogy": "This is like a university lecture where the professors (the cited sources) are being quoted, but your company is a student in the audience. To get noticed and cited by the AI, you need to publish your own definitive textbook (authoritative content) that becomes part of the curriculum."

  "ai_answer_deconstruction": {
    "dominant_narrative": "The AI is acting as an educator, providing a structured, definitional comparison of two complex marketing analytics concepts. The narrative focuses on clarifying the purpose, granularity, and timeframe of each method, positioning them as complementary tools for strategic and tactical decision-making.",

      "Clear definitions for 'Attribution Modeling' and 'Cohort Analysis'",

    ],
    "trusted_source_analysis": "The AI exclusively trusts content-driven sources, such as company blogs, glossaries, and resource guides from businesses within the marketing and data analytics industry. It is not citing product pages or commercial websites, prioritizing deep educational content over product-specific information for this type of query."

    "if_featured": null,
    "if_not_featured": {
      "exclusion_reasons": "Linkrunner was excluded because the AI is seeking to answer a 'what is' question, not a 'what to buy' question.

      "path_to_inclusion": "The path to inclusion is to become a source. This requires creating a definitive, well-structured article on the Linkrunner blog that comprehensively answers the user's query.
