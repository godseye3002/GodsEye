# GodsEye — Brochure Content Draft

---

## Page 1 — Cover / Hook

**Headline:**
Your customers are asking AI who to trust.
Is your brand the answer?

**Subheadline:**
Most companies have invested years in SEO. But SEO gets you ranked on Google.
AEO gets you *recommended* by AI.
These are two completely different games — and most companies are only playing one.

**Stat:**
80% of users never click a single link when AI gives them a direct answer.
If you're not named in that answer, you don't exist to that buyer.

## Page 2 — The Problem (Plain English)

**Heading:** The way people search has changed. Your visibility strategy hasn't.

Two or three years ago, people searched Google, saw 10 links, and clicked.
Today, they open ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Google AI Mode and ask a question. They get one answer. They trust it. They act on it.

Here's what that means for your business:

| Feature | SEO (Google) | AEO (AI Search) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Goal** | Ranked in list | Recommended as answer |
| **User Action** | Click a link | Read and decide |
| **Key Metric** | Traffic Volume | Trust & Answer Share |

**Your Google ranking doesn't matter if AI doesn't mention you.**
A parent looking for the best JEE coaching, a founder researching a SaaS tool, a buyer comparing products — they're not clicking links anymore. They're reading the AI's answer and deciding.

If your competitor appears in that answer and you don't, you've lost the sale before you even knew the conversation was happening.

**The hidden problem most companies miss:**
Your website might actually be cited by AI — but the wrong parts are being read.

AI crawlers are selective. They don't read your entire page. They extract the top layer — whatever is most accessible in your HTML structure. If your USP is buried, if your competitor's name appears more prominently in your own blog, if your product description isn't structured the way AI expects — the AI will pull that content, misrepresent you, and move on.

You could be actively hurting your own visibility without knowing it.

## Page 3 — What GodsEye Does (Step by Step)

**Heading:** We find exactly where you're losing — and tell you exactly how to fix it.

GodsEye audits your AI visibility, identifies the gaps, and gives you a specific plan your team can implement immediately.

Here's the full process:

**Step 1 — AI Visibility Audit**
We run hundreds of real-world queries across Google AI Mode, Perplexity, ChatGPT, and Gemini — the same queries your customers are typing. We extract every response, every citation, every source that AI chose over you.

You get two scores:
- **Visibility Score** — how often your brand appears in AI-generated answers
- **AI Presence Score** — how often your website is actually selected as a source

**Step 2 — Deep Source Analysis**
For every query where you're not appearing, we scrape and analyze the pages that ARE being cited. We reverse-engineer what the AI preferred — the content structure, word count, HTML hierarchy, how those pages described their product.

Then we compare that directly against your site and show you the exact gap.

**Step 3 — Your Fix Plan**
You get a ranked, specific action list:
- Which HTML elements to restructure
- Which pages need content changes
- Which new blogs to write (and exactly how to structure them)
- Which queries to target first for fastest results

Nothing vague. Everything is implementable.

**Step 4 — Execute in Workflow**
GodsEye plugs directly into your team's workflow. It’s like giving your developer an AI co-pilot that knows your strategy. (This allows your tech team to fix things instantly inside their coding environment).

**Step 5 — Re-Audit & Track Progress**
Once changes go live, we re-run the audit for the same queries. You see movement in your visibility score and AI Presence Score over time. You know what worked.

## Page 4 — What This Means for Your Business (The "In-Charge" Test)

**Heading:** If GodsEye were running your AEO — here's what would change.

This is the part most tools skip. Not just "what we do" — but what it actually means for your company's growth.

**If you're in edtech:**
Parents are the buyers. Parents are not clicking links — they are asking AI. If a parent asks "best coaching for JEE 2025" and your brand doesn't appear, that is a lost admission. Not a missed click. A lost admission. Multiply that by the number of times that query is asked every day.

**If you're in SaaS:**
Founders and growth teams now use AI to shortlist tools before they ever visit a product page. If ChatGPT recommends your competitor and not you, you never even get a trial signup. You're invisible at the top of the funnel.

**The compounding effect:**
AI visibility builds over time, the same way SEO does. The companies that optimize now will become the default recommendation across every AI platform. The ones that wait will spend years trying to catch up — just like they did with Google.

**What GodsEye specifically changes for your team:**

Your SEO person currently optimizes for Google's algorithm. GodsEye adds a second layer — optimizing for AI algorithms — using the same content, the same website, the same team. We make their work more targeted and more effective, not redundant.

Time investment from your side: **1–2 hours per week**, implementing the changes GodsEye surfaces.

## Page 5 — Why GodsEye, Why Now

**Heading:** This window is open. It won't be for long.

AI search is not a future trend. It is the current behavior of your customers. The companies building AI visibility now are establishing the same first-mover advantage that companies who invested early in SEO held for years.

**What makes GodsEye different from other AEO tools:**

Most AEO tools stop at giving you data — your visibility score, your citation count. That's useful, but it doesn't tell you what to actually do.

GodsEye goes deeper:
- We scrape and analyze the competing sources AI actually chose
- We compare them structurally against your pages
- We generate a specific, prioritized action plan
- We plug data directly into your team's workflow so fixes happen instantly—no new dashboard to learn.

You're not buying a dashboard. You're buying clarity on exactly what to fix and the ability to fix it immediately.

**Our current stage:**
We are working with early clients on a free pilot basis. No cost. Full analysis, full access, full plan — in exchange for your feedback on the product.

If you see value in what the audit surfaces, we continue. If not, you keep the analysis.

## Page 6 — Getting Started

**Heading:** Three steps to know exactly where you stand.

**Step 1:** Share basic product information with us — your website, key product pages, and the queries your customers use to find you.

**Step 2:** We run the full AI visibility audit (48–72 hours). You receive your visibility score, citation rate, competitor comparison, and a ranked fix plan.

**Step 3:** Implement fixes via GodsEye inside your workflow & see results. We re-audit after changes go live.

**The ask:** One conversation. One audit. See the numbers for yourself.
