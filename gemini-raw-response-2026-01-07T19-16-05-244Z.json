    "title": "Your AEO Competitive Analysis for Linkrunner",
    "status_overview": "Your product was not featured, as the AI currently prioritizes well-established, market-leading platforms that are clearly segmented into either 'Marketing Attribution Platforms' or 'Product & User Behavior Analytics Tools'.",
    "strategic_analogy": "This is like trying to get a new artist played on a radio station with only two shows: 'Classic Rock' and 'Top 40 Pop'. Your product is a promising indie artist that doesn't fit neatly into these rigid categories, so it's being overlooked for the established headliners."

It presents a structured market map rather than a simple list.",

    "analysis_summary": "Linkrunner's absence is due to a combination of lower brand authority compared to the mentioned giants and a product positioning that doesn't fit cleanly into the AI's defined categories of 'Marketing Attribution' or 'Product Analytics'. The AI is rewarding established players with clearly defined, often specialized, roles in the marketing tech stack.",
    "if_featured": null,
    "if_not_featured": {
      "exclusion_reasons": "Your product was not mentioned because: 1. It lacks the brand authority and market penetration of competitors like Google, HubSpot, and Mixpanel. 2. Its positioning as a 'Link Tracking and Analytics' tool is too general and doesn't align with the specific, high-level categories the AI has created. 3. It is not featured in the authoritative third-party 'best of' listicles that the AI is using as trusted sources.",
      "path_to_inclusion": "To get featured, Linkrunner must sharpen its market positioning to align with an established category (e.g., 'The simplest attribution tool for growth marketers') or create a new, specific niche (e.g., 'The only tool for tracking onboarding impact from social channels'). The most critical path is to pursue a digital PR strategy to gain mentions and reviews on the types of marketing tech blogs the AI is citing, as this builds the necessary third-party validation."
