    "title": "Your AEO Competitive Analysis for Avyott Talk",
    "status_overview": "Your product was not featured, as the AI currently prioritizes AI voice solutions that clearly articulate specific, quantifiable features like low latency, no-code deployment, and direct CRM integrations on their web properties.",
    "strategic_analogy": "This is like entering a car race with a brochure that says 'fast and reliable.' Your competitors have brought spec sheets listing horsepower, 0-60 times, and braking distance. The AI is a technical judge rewarding measurable performance data, and your product's marketing isn't providing it."

    "status": "Not Featured",
    "details": "Avyott Talk was not mentioned in the AI's overview text or cited in the source links."
  },
  "ai_answer_deconstruction": {
    "dominant_narrative": "The AI is constructing a narrative that categorizes AI voice solutions into two main types: comprehensive, all-in-one contact center platforms (like VoiceSpin) and specialized, high-performance voice agents (like Synthflow and Retell AI). The selection is driven by specific technical capabilities and clear business use cases.",
    "key_decision_factors": [
      "Specific technical features (e.g., no-code deployment, low latency, multilingual support)",
      "Clear use cases (e.g., contact centers, enterprises, inbound support)",
      "Integration capabilities (e.g., CRM actions, seamless human handoffs)",
      "Quantifiable metrics (e.g., latency in milliseconds, number of languages supported)",
      "Source authority (direct brand blogs and homepages detailing these features)."
    ],
    "trusted_source_analysis": "The AI demonstrates high trust in direct brand-owned content, specifically blog posts and homepages that provide detailed feature comparisons and technical specifications. It is rewarding companies that use their own web properties to clearly define their market position and technical advantages."

  "strategic_gap_and_opportunity_analysis": {
    "analysis_summary": "Avyott Talk is currently invisible to the AI for this query because its online messaging is too generic. The AI is rewarding competitors who clearly and specifically articulate their technical features (e.g., 'no-code', '600ms latency'), target use cases ('enterprises', 'contact centers'), and integration capabilities. Avyott Talk's description of 'automating complex workflows' lacks the concrete data points the AI uses for evaluation and comparison.",
    "if_featured": {
      "current_positioning": null,
      "opportunities_for_improvement": null
    },
    "if_not_featured": {
      "exclusion_reasons": "The primary reason for exclusion is a lack of specific, quantifiable features and clearly defined use cases in your product's description. Competitors are winning by explicitly stating things like 'no-code deployment', 'lowest latency (~600ms)', and targeting niches like 'enterprises' or 'high-volume operations', which your general messaging about 'customer interaction automation' fails to compete with.",
      "path_to_inclusion": "Revamp your product website and marketing materials to highlight specific, measurable features (e.g., average latency, number of integrations, setup time). Create targeted content, such as blog posts or comparison pages, that directly address the key decision factors the AI has identified, such as 'low latency AI voice for sales' or 'no-code voice agent for Zendesk'. This will create the specific, data-rich content the AI is looking for."

  },
  "actionable_recommendations": [
    {
      "recommendation": "Content Structure Enhancement",
      "action": "On your primary product page, implement a clear, scannable structure using H2/H3 tags for 'Key Features', 'Technical Specifications' (listing latency, integrations, etc.), and 'Ideal Use Cases'. Use a comparison table to show how Avyott Talk stacks up against market alternatives on these key metrics."
    },
    {
      "recommendation": "Keyword and Claim Alignment",
      "action": "Incorporate the specific terminology the AI is rewarding into your web copy. This includes phrases like 'low latency conversational AI', 'no-code voice agent builder', 'CRM integration', 'scalable for enterprises', and 'realistic voice'."
    },
    {
      "recommendation": "Third-Party Validation Strategy",
      "action": "Create and promote content that establishes you as a thought leader, similar to the competitor blog posts cited by the AI. Pursue listings on business software review sites like G2 or Capterra, ensuring your profile is filled out with the specific technical details and features that are currently missing."
