    "title": "Your AEO Competitive Analysis for Linkrunner - 2",
    "status_overview": "Your product was not featured, as the AI currently prioritizes established platforms with clear pricing models (especially free tiers) and specific use-cases like SEO or CRM, which are validated by third-party blog and content sources.",
    "strategic_analogy": "This is like trying to enter a car race with a powerful, custom-built engine but no car chassis. Your AI and tracking capabilities are strong, but they aren't packaged in a way the judges (the AI) recognize—a clearly defined vehicle like 'the free web analytics car' or 'the all-in-one CRM car'."

  "ai_answer_deconstruction": {
    "dominant_narrative": "The AI is constructing a narrative around providing a portfolio of solutions for small businesses, categorizing each tool by its primary strength and pricing model. The story is: start with a free, powerful tool like Google Analytics, then consider specialized or all-in-one platforms like HubSpot or SEMrush as your needs and budget grow.",
    "key_decision_factors": [
      "Specific use-case (e.g., web analytics, SEO, CRM, product analytics)",
      "Clear pricing model (e.g., free, free tier, specific monthly cost)",
      "Brand recognition and establishment",
      "Integration capabilities (e.g., Google Ads, CRM)",
      "Source authority (mentions on marketing blogs and content platforms)"
    ],
    "trusted_source_analysis": "The AI relies on third-party content, specifically 'best of' listicles and articles from marketing tech company blogs (ConvertMate, Velainn) and professional content platforms (LinkedIn). It trusts sources that compare and categorize multiple tools for a specific audience."

  "strategic_gap_and_opportunity_analysis": {
    "analysis_summary": "The primary gap is a lack of third-party validation from the types of sources the AI trusts for this query. Competitors are winning because they are featured in 'best of' listicles that categorize them by specific function and price point, making them easy for the AI to understand and recommend. Your product's powerful features are not being translated into these simple, comparative terms within the AI's source material.",
    "if_featured": null,
    "if_not_featured": {
      "exclusion_reasons": "Your product was excluded because it lacks mentions in the third-party marketing blogs the AI uses as trusted sources. Furthermore, the AI prioritizes tools with explicitly stated pricing (especially 'free' tiers) and well-defined categories (e.g., 'CRM', 'SEO tool'), which are currently clearer for competitors.",
      "path_to_inclusion": "The primary path to inclusion is securing mentions in 'best marketing analytics tools' listicles on authoritative marketing blogs. Concurrently, update your website to clearly state a starting price or free trial option and frame the product's AI features in the context of solving specific small business problems like 'optimizing ad spend' or 'improving conversion rates'."
