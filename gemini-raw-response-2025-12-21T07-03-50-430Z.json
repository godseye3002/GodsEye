    "title": "Your AEO Competitive Analysis for Linkrunner",
    "status_overview": "Your product was not featured, as the AI's response focused exclusively on established, canonical examples of Mobile Measurement Partners (MMPs), a specific term used in the user's query.",
    "strategic_analogy": "This is like being a talented jazz musician at a classical music audition. Your product has the right skills, but it's not using the specific terminology—'MMP'—that the judges are listening for, so it wasn't called to the stage."
  },
  "client_product_visibility": {
    "status": "Not Featured",
    "details": "Linkrunner was not mentioned in the AI overview. The response focused on defining the MMP category and listed Adjust, AppsFlyer, and Kochava as representative examples."
  },
  "ai_answer_deconstruction": {
    "dominant_narrative": "The AI is adopting an educational, encyclopedic tone. It defines the 'Mobile Measurement Partner (MMP)' category, explains its core functions like attribution and deep linking for growth marketers, and then provides a list of well-known industry players as examples.",
    "key_decision_factors": [
      "Explicit categorization as a 'Mobile Measurement Partner (MMP)'",
      "Industry recognition as a canonical example of the technology",
      "Association with core MMP functions like attribution, deep linking, and user journey tracking"
    ],
    "trusted_source_analysis": "The AI did not cite any external sources, as the 'source_links' array was empty. This indicates the response was generated entirely from its foundational training data, relying on its internal knowledge graph of established entities within the MMP market. It trusts its own corpus of information about major industry players."

  "competitive_landscape_analysis": [
    {
      "competitor_name": "Adjust",

  "strategic_gap_and_opportunity_analysis": {
    "analysis_summary": "The analysis centers on why Linkrunner was not featured. The core issue is a mismatch in product categorization and terminology between your product's description and the AI's understanding of the user's query.",
    "if_featured": null,
    "if_not_featured": {
      "exclusion_reasons": "The primary reason for exclusion is a terminology and categorization gap. The AI's response was triggered by the specific term 'MMP', and it rewarded products that are canonically defined as such. Your product, Linkrunner, is described as a 'Link Tracking and Analytics Tool', which is functionally similar but lacks the specific 'MMP' label that the AI used as its primary filter.",
      "path_to_inclusion": "To get featured, you must align your product's public-facing content with the 'MMP' category. Revise your website copy, create blog posts, and seek third-party mentions that explicitly describe Linkrunner as a 'Mobile Measurement Partner (MMP)'. Creating content that directly compares Linkrunner to the featured competitors (e.g., 'A modern Adjust alternative') will also help build this association in the AI's knowledge graph."

  "actionable_recommendations": [
    {
      "recommendation": "Category and Keyword Alignment",
      "action": "Update your website's homepage, product pages, and metadata to explicitly use the terms 'Mobile Measurement Partner' and 'MMP'. Frame Linkrunner not just as a link tracker, but as a comprehensive MMP solution for growth marketers."
    },
    {
      "recommendation": "Competitive Positioning Content",
      "action": "Create dedicated landing pages and blog posts that position Linkrunner as an alternative to the mentioned competitors (e.g., 'Linkrunner vs. Adjust', 'Why Choose Linkrunner over AppsFlyer'). This directly creates the semantic association the AI is currently missing."
    },
    {
      "recommendation": "Establish Category Authority",
      "action": "Pursue features, reviews, and listings on marketing technology blogs, software review sites (like G2, Capterra), and industry publications. Ensure these third-party sources refer to Linkrunner as an 'MMP' to build external validation and authority for that category."
