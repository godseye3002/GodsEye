    "strategic_analogy": "This is like trying to get a new band reviewed in Rolling Stone's 'Top 100 Albums' list. The AI is acting as the editor, exclusively citing established artists with existing reviews and a known reputation, making third-party validation the only way to break into the conversation."

    "analysis_summary": "The primary reason for your product's exclusion is a lack of presence in the authoritative third-party sources the AI uses to identify leading MMPs. The AI's entire answer is constructed from a pre-existing consensus of top players found in articles like 'Which Mobile MMP to Choose for 2024'. Competitors have successfully established themselves in this ecosystem, each with a clearly defined niche that the AI can easily extract and present.",
    "if_featured": null,
    "if_not_featured": {
      "exclusion_reasons": "Your product was excluded because it is not mentioned in the key third-party comparison articles the AI relies on. Furthermore, your product's positioning around 'AI-driven insights' is not as distinct or easily categorized as competitors' core strengths like 'fraud prevention' (Adjust) or 'deep linking' (Branch.io), which are explicitly highlighted by the AI. Your online presence also lacks explicit mention of table-stakes features like SKAdNetwork support and fraud detection, which the AI identifies as key evaluation criteria.",
      "path_to_inclusion": "The most critical path to inclusion is securing mentions and positive reviews in industry blogs and tech comparison websites similar to those cited by the AI (e.g., Boomit, SplitMetrics). Refine your product's marketing message to highlight a unique, tangible benefit of its AI capabilities (e.g., 'AI-powered predictive LTV' or 'Automated Anomaly Detection'). Finally, update your website content to explicitly detail your platform's features in relation to the key decision factors the AI uses, such as 'Fraud Detection Suite', 'SKAdNetwork 4.0 Ready', and 'Pre-built Integrations'."

Instead of the generic 'AI-driven insights', use more specific, benefit-oriented phrases like 'AI-powered ROAS optimization' or 'predictive attribution models'. Ensure these phrases are used consistently across your site title tags, meta descriptions, and body content."
