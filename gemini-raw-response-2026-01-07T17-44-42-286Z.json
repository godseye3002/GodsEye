    "title": "Your AEO Competitive Analysis for Linkrunner",
    "status_overview": "Your product was not featured, as the AI currently prioritizes tools that are either foundational market leaders or have a highly specialized, clearly defined use case (e.g., multi-touch attribution, product analytics, mobile-first) supported by authoritative content.",
    "strategic_analogy": "This is like trying to enter a specialized medical conference with a 'general wellness' product. The AI is rewarding specialists who solve a very specific diagnostic problem, and your product's current positioning isn't narrow enough to earn a spot on the panel."

    "dominant_narrative": "The AI is building a narrative that selecting the right analytics tool is not a one-size-fits-all decision. It acts as a consultant, categorizing 'best' tools by specific business needs and use cases, such as multi-touch attribution for ad spend, deep user behavior analysis, mobile-first tracking, or connecting marketing to CRM revenue.",

    "trusted_source_analysis": "The AI demonstrates high trust in a combination of direct brand websites (especially those with strong blog content like Cometly), official product pages from market leaders (Google, HubSpot), and authoritative third-party content from marketing-focused blogs and publications that publish comparative listicles (e.g., '9 Best Attribution Software Tools')."

Your product's messaging doesn't align strongly with any of these specific, high-value buckets.",

Clearly define your ideal use case using the terminology the AI favors (e.g., 'The Leading Attribution Platform for Mobile-First Marketers' or 'Advanced Channel Analytics for Growth Teams'). Create targeted blog content and landing pages that address the specific problems mentioned in the user queries (e.g., 'How to Solve Channel Attribution with Linkrunner').

Create dedicated sections explaining how Linkrunner excels at these functions."

Reach out to them for inclusion, offering a demo or free trial. Securing mentions on these authoritative domains is critical for building the external trust the AI relies on."
