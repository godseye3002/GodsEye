  "executive_summary": {
    "title": "Your AEO Competitive Analysis for Linkrunner",
    "status_overview": "Your product was not featured, as the AI currently prioritizes established platforms that explicitly identify as 'Mobile Measurement Partners' (MMP) and detail features specific to the mobile app ecosystem.",
    "strategic_analogy": "This is like entering a 'Best Diesel Engine' competition with a high-performance electric motor. While your technology is powerful and relevant to transportation, you're not using the specific terminology and classification the judges are looking for, causing you to be excluded."
  },
  "client_product_visibility": {
    "status": "Not Featured",
    "details": "Linkrunner was not mentioned by name in the AI's overview text, nor was its URL included in the source links."
  },
  "ai_answer_deconstruction": {
    "dominant_narrative": "The AI is constructing a narrative for a technical audience, defining what a Mobile Measurement Partner (MMP) is and then listing established software solutions that fit this precise definition, focusing on features like SDK integration, fraud detection, and deep linking for mobile apps.",
    "key_decision_factors": [
      "Explicit self-identification as a 'Mobile Measurement Partner (MMP)'",
      "Features specific to mobile app campaigns (e.g., SDK integration, deep linking, postbacks)",
      "Mention of core functionalities like fraud detection, attribution, and cohort analysis",
      "Source authority from direct brand websites with dedicated MMP-focused pages"
    ],
    "trusted_source_analysis": "The AI demonstrates high trust in direct brand websites that have dedicated landing pages or glossaries defining their role as an MMP (e.g., singular.net/mmp/, branch.io/glossary/...). It also cites informational content from adjacent marketing tech companies to define the category."

  "strategic_gap_and_opportunity_analysis": {
    "analysis_summary": "The primary reason for Linkrunner's exclusion is a mismatch in terminology and market positioning. The AI is specifically looking for platforms that label themselves as 'MMP' and focus on the mobile app ecosystem, while Linkrunner is positioned more broadly as a 'Link Tracking and Analytics Tool.' To appear in this type of search, Linkrunner must align its language with the specific technical category the AI has identified as relevant.",
    "if_featured": null,
    "if_not_featured": {
      "exclusion_reasons": "Your product was not mentioned because its online content does not use the specific industry term 'Mobile Measurement Partner (MMP)', which was the core of the user's query. Competitors are winning because they explicitly position themselves as MMPs and detail features like SDKs and deep linking, which directly match the AI's understanding of the query.",
      "path_to_inclusion": "Create dedicated content (e.g., a landing page or blog post) titled 'Linkrunner: Your Mobile Measurement Partner Solution'. This page should explicitly map your features (Performance Tracking) to core MMP functionalities (attribution, conversion tracking, fraud detection) and use the keywords the AI is rewarding. This will align your product with the specific technical category the AI is searching for."

      "action": "Integrate key MMP-related terms such as 'mobile attribution', 'deep linking', 'conversion tracking', 'fraud detection', and 'postbacks' into your product descriptions, marketing copy, and website metadata to signal your relevance for these specific queries."

      "recommendation": "Third-Party Validation Strategy",
      "action": "Develop a strategy to get Linkrunner featured in articles and roundups titled 'Best MMP Software' or 'Top Mobile Measurement Partners' on marketing technology blogs and review sites. This builds the third-party validation the AI uses to identify authoritative players in a niche."
