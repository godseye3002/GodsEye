    "title": "Your AEO Competitive Analysis for Avyott Talk",
    "status_overview": "Your product was not featured, as the AI prioritizes solutions that are explicitly categorized for specific small business needs (e.g., no-code, developer-first) and have detailed online content addressing key integration and feature requirements.",
    "strategic_analogy": "This is like showing up to a job interview for a specific engineering role with a general resume that just says 'good at computers'. The AI is hiring based on a detailed checklist of skills (integrations, NLU, security), and competitors are providing itemized proof of their qualifications on their websites and blogs."
  },
  "client_product_visibility": {
    "status": "Not Featured",
    "details": "Avyott Talk was not mentioned by name in the AI overview text, its list of recommended tools, or within any of the cited source links."
  },
  "ai_answer_deconstruction": {
    "dominant_narrative": "The AI is acting as a consultant, providing a detailed checklist for small businesses to evaluate AI voice solutions based on critical integration capabilities, conversational quality, and customer experience. It then recommends specific tools tailored to different user segments (Overall SMB, No-Code, Developer-First).",
    "key_decision_factors": [
      "Specific integrations (CRM, VoIP, Calendars)",
      "Low-Code/No-Code setup capability",
      "Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and interruption handling",
      "Seamless human handoff procedures",
      "Data privacy and security compliance (GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA)",
      "Transparent pricing models",
      "Availability of a free trial or pilot program"
    ],
    "trusted_source_analysis": "The AI trusts a mix of competitor-owned blogs that provide high-value, educational content (Tabbly.io, Smith.ai), general tech publications (Hackernoon), and specialized AI/automation blogs. This indicates that becoming a source of information is a powerful path to inclusion."

  "strategic_gap_and_opportunity_analysis": {
    "analysis_summary": "Avyott Talk is currently invisible to the AI for this query because its online presence lacks the specificity and authority the AI is rewarding. Competitors are winning by creating detailed content that directly maps to the AI's evaluation checklist (e.g., specific integrations, no-code features) and by establishing themselves as thought leaders through their own blogs, which are then cited as sources.",
    "if_featured": null,
    "if_not_featured": {
      "exclusion_reasons": "The primary reasons for exclusion are: 1) A lack of specific feature and integration details in your product description (e.g., naming CRMs like HubSpot, phone systems like RingCentral). 2) No content positioning Avyott Talk for a specific SMB segment (e.g., 'no-code' or 'overall best'). 3) The absence of authoritative, educational content on your domain that could be used as a source by the AI, unlike competitors Tabbly and Smith.ai.",
      "path_to_inclusion": "To get featured, you must align your website content with the AI's checklist. Create dedicated pages or detailed sections on your product page for 'Integrations', listing specific platforms by name. Develop content (blog posts, case studies) targeting 'small business AI voice automation' and its challenges. Emphasize any 'no-code' or 'low-code' capabilities to compete with Lindy and Synthflow. The long-term goal is to publish content authoritative enough to be cited as a source."
