    "title": "Your AEO Competitive Analysis for Linkrunner - 2",
    "status_overview": "Your product was not featured, as the AI currently prioritizes marketing measurement platforms that have a clearly defined, specific use case (e.g., B2B, e-commerce, call tracking) and are validated by mentions in third-party 'Best Of' listicles.",
    "strategic_analogy": "This is like entering a specialized tool competition with a high-quality multi-tool. While versatile and powerful, the judges are awarding prizes to the best Phillips-head screwdriver and the best Allen wrench, rewarding competitors who solve one problem exceptionally well and are recognized for that specific function."

  "ai_answer_deconstruction": {
    "dominant_narrative": "The AI is building a narrative around helping users select the right tool by categorizing platforms based on their business model and specific needs. It frames the decision not as finding a single 'best' tool, but as finding the right fit, distinguishing between comprehensive all-in-one platforms, specialized deep-dive tools for niches like B2B or e-commerce, and foundational free tools.",
    "key_decision_factors": [
      "Specific business model focus (e.g., B2B, e-commerce, businesses with call conversions)",
      "Integration capabilities with existing tech stacks (CRM, ad platforms)",
      "Solution category (All-in-One CRM vs. Specialized Attribution Tool vs. Foundational Analytics)",
      "Mention of advanced features like AI, server-side tracking, and multi-touch attribution models",
      "Source authority from direct brand websites and, critically, third-party marketing technology blogs publishing 'Best Of' lists"
    ],
    "trusted_source_analysis": "The AI demonstrates high trust in a combination of direct brand websites for specific product details (HubSpot, Salesforce, Cometly) and authoritative third-party content from marketing tech blogs and software companies (Salesmate, Hockeystack, Contentsquare) that publish comparative guides and listicles. This blend indicates the AI values both brand-level information and external validation."

  "strategic_gap_and_opportunity_analysis": {
    "analysis_summary": "The primary reason for Linkrunner - 2's exclusion is a lack of specific market positioning and absence from the third-party validation sources the AI heavily relies upon. While the product has relevant features like 'AI-Driven Insights,' its online messaging is too broad compared to competitors who are winning by owning a clearly defined niche.",
    "if_featured": null,
    "if_not_featured": {
      "exclusion_reasons": "Your product was not mentioned because its positioning as a general 'AI-driven MMP' is not specific enough. The AI rewarded competitors with clearly defined target markets, such as 'Cometly for e-commerce' or 'Dreamdata for B2B'. Furthermore, your product lacks mentions in the 'Best of' listicles from marketing tech blogs, which the AI is using as key authoritative sources to build its recommendations.",
      "path_to_inclusion": "To get featured, you must first sharpen your product's positioning to target a specific, defensible niche (e.g., 'The leading MMP for SaaS companies' or 'AI-attribution for mobile apps'). Update your website and content marketing to reflect this focus, using the specific terminology the AI is rewarding. The most critical step is to then execute a digital PR and content strategy to secure features and positive mentions on the types of third-party review sites and blogs cited by the AI."

Revamp the homepage and product pages to lead with this positioning (e.g., 'The AI-Powered MMP for B2B SaaS'). Create dedicated landing pages explaining how your features solve the unique problems of that niche."

      "recommendation": "Keyword and Claim Alignment",
      "action": "Integrate the specific terms and concepts the AI highlights into your product descriptions. Use phrases like 'multi-touch attribution models,' 'full customer journey mapping,' 'connects ad spend to revenue,' and 'integrates with [Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.]' prominently in your content."
    },
    {
      "recommendation": "Third-Party Validation Strategy",
      "action": "Identify and build relationships with marketing technology blogs and software review sites similar to those in the AI's sources (e.g., Salesmate, Hockeystack). Actively pursue getting Linkrunner - 2 included in their 'Best Marketing Measurement Platforms' and 'Top Attribution Software' listicles and reviews. This external validation is a key signal for the AI."
