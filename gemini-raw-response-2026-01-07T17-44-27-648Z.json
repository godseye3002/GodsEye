  "executive_summary": {
    "title": "Your AEO Competitive Analysis for Linkrunner",
    "status_overview": "Your product was not featured, as the AI currently prioritizes established competitors with highly specific, named features (e.g., 'cookieless tracking', 'call tracking') that are mentioned on authoritative third-party marketing tech review sites.",
    "strategic_analogy": "This is like trying to get a restaurant recommended by a city guide that only lists places reviewed in major food blogs. While your restaurant may be excellent, you're invisible because you're not in the guide's trusted sources. To get recommended, you first need to get reviewed."
  },
  "client_product_visibility": {
    "status": "Not Featured",
    "details": "Linkrunner was not mentioned by name or brand in the AI-generated overview text or source links across any of the analyzed queries."
  },
  "ai_answer_deconstruction": {
    "dominant_narrative": "The AI is building a narrative around providing specialized tools for specific marketing analytics problems. Instead of a single 'best' tool, it segments the market by use case—affiliate link tracking, sales attribution, e-commerce analytics, and full-funnel channel performance—and recommends a distinct leader for each category.",
    "key_decision_factors": [
      "Specific, named features (e.g., cookieless tracking, multi-touch attribution, call tracking, fraud detection)",
      "Clear target user segment (e.g., Affiliates, Agencies, E-commerce, B2B)",
      "Integration capabilities (e.g., CRM, Google Ads, Meta, Shopify)",
      "Source authority (mentions on marketing technology blogs, review sites, and brand pages)",
      "Pricing model clarity (e.g., free trials, pricing tiers)"
    ],
    "trusted_source_analysis": "The AI demonstrates high trust in a mix of authoritative third-party content sites (e.g., influencermarketinghub.com, waltervoronovic.com), direct brand blogs from established players (e.g., improvado.io, ruleranalytics.com), and general tech publications. Inclusion in these 'best of' lists appears to be a primary driver for being featured."

  "strategic_gap_and_opportunity_analysis": {
    "analysis_summary": "Linkrunner's absence from the AI's responses stems from two core issues: a lack of visibility on the authoritative third-party review sites the AI uses as its primary sources, and product messaging that is less specific than its competitors. The AI rewards tools that are clearly defined by advanced features and target use cases, a positioning Linkrunner can adopt to gain visibility.",
    "if_featured": null,
    "if_not_featured": {
      "exclusion_reasons": "Your product was not mentioned because it is not present in the third-party 'best of' lists and software roundups that the AI relies on for its recommendations. Furthermore, your current product description, while clear, lacks the specific, technical keywords (e.g., 'multi-touch attribution', 'cookieless tracking', 'CRM integration') that the AI is extracting from competitor sites to define and rank the top tools.",
      "path_to_inclusion": "The primary path is to secure placement in articles and reviews on authoritative marketing tech blogs like those cited by the AI. Concurrently, refine your website's product and feature pages to explicitly name and detail advanced functionalities. Frame Linkrunner not just as a 'Onelink alternative' but as a solution for specific problems, such as 'multi-channel attribution for growth marketers' or 'funnel analytics for SaaS onboarding'."

  },
  "actionable_recommendations": [
    {
      "recommendation": "Content Structure Enhancement",
      "action": "On your primary product pages, create dedicated, easily scannable sections using H2/H3 tags for 'Key Features', 'Integrations' (list specific platforms like Meta, Google Ads, etc.), and 'Use Cases' (e.g., 'For Growth Marketers', 'For App Marketers'). This makes critical information highly parsable for AI crawlers."
    },
    {
      "recommendation": "Keyword and Claim Alignment",
      "action": "Audit the language used by featured competitors like ClickMagick, Hyros, and RedTrack. Integrate specific, high-value terms such as 'multi-touch attribution', 'channel ROI analysis', 'first-party data', and 'funnel drop-off analysis' into your product descriptions, meta titles, and feature lists to align with the AI's decision factors."
    },
    {
      "recommendation": "Third-Party Validation Strategy",
      "action": "Identify the top 10-15 marketing software review blogs (starting with those cited in the AI's sources like waltervoronovic.com and influencermarketinghub.com). Launch a targeted outreach campaign to get Linkrunner reviewed, compared, or included in their 'Best Link Tracking Software' listicles."
