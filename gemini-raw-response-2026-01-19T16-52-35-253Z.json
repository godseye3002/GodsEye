    "title": "Your AEO Competitive Analysis for Linkrunner",
    "status_overview": "Your product was not featured, as the AI currently prioritizes established marketing platforms with content that explicitly details their ROI tracking capabilities, CRM integrations, and specific use cases like agency reporting.",
    "strategic_analogy": "This is like entering a business pitch competition where the judges are only scoring on 'revenue generated'. Your product excellently details the 'activities performed' but fails to explicitly connect those activities to the final revenue numbers, which is what the winning competitors are doing."

    "analysis_summary": "Linkrunner's absence from the AI response stems from two primary factors. First, its core value proposition (tracking clicks, downloads) is not explicitly framed in the language of 'ROI tracking' or 'revenue attribution', which is central to the query. Second, the AI's answer is heavily influenced by a third-party comparative article from a competitor. Linkrunner's lack of presence in such authoritative, industry-spanning content makes it invisible to the AI for this type of query.",
    "if_featured": null,
    "if_not_featured": {
      "exclusion_reasons": "Linkrunner was excluded because its online messaging, as described, focuses on tracking 'actions' (clicks, downloads) rather than explicitly connecting these actions to 'ROI' and 'revenue', which is the core of the user's query. Furthermore, it lacks mentions in the kind of authoritative third-party comparison articles the AI is using as its primary source.",
      "path_to_inclusion": "Create dedicated content on the Linkrunner website that explicitly details its 'ROI tracking' capabilities, with case studies showing how to measure revenue from distribution channels. The most critical step is to pursue a third-party content strategy to get Linkrunner featured in 'best marketing ROI platforms' articles and reviews on reputable marketing tech blogs, mirroring the source the AI currently trusts."
