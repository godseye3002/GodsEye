The AI is rewarding platforms that explicitly solve the user's pain point of 'overcomplication' with keywords like 'simple,' 'fast setup,' and 'intuitive.' Linkrunner's messaging focuses on technical capabilities ('AI-driven insights', 'granular tracking') without translating them into the simplicity-focused benefits the AI is looking for. Furthermore, Linkrunner lacks presence in the third-party marketing tech blogs that the AI heavily relies on for recommendations.",
