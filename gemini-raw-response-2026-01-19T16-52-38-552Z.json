    "title": "Your AEO Competitive Analysis for Linkrunner",
    "status_overview": "Your product was not featured, as the AI currently prioritizes attribution software that explicitly details its support for specific multi-touch models and is sourced from authoritative brand content explaining these capabilities.",
    "strategic_analogy": "This is like showing up to a car race with a high-tech boat. Your product is powerful and tracks movement effectively, but it's not being recognized because it isn't speaking the specific language of 'on-road attribution models' that the AI judges are looking for."

    "dominant_narrative": "The AI is building a narrative that marketing attribution software is essential for optimizing ad spend and ROI. It highlights solutions based on their specific features, such as the types of attribution models they offer (multi-touch, algorithmic), their target market (B2B, e-commerce), and advanced capabilities like AI-driven insights and cross-channel tracking.",
    "key_decision_factors": [
      "Explicit mention of specific attribution models (e.g., multi-touch, algorithmic, linear, time-decay)",

      "Integration capabilities with CRMs and ad platforms"
    ],
    "trusted_source_analysis": "The AI demonstrates high trust in direct brand-owned content, specifically product pages and blog posts that provide detailed descriptions and comparisons of attribution software.

  "strategic_gap_and_opportunity_analysis": {
    "analysis_summary": "Linkrunner's absence from the AI response stems from a misalignment in terminology and positioning. While its features are relevant, they are not framed using the specific 'attribution' language and model types that the AI has identified as key decision factors from competitor content. The path to inclusion requires a strategic update of website content to align with the AI's established narrative for this software category.",
    "if_featured": null,
    "if_not_featured": {
      "exclusion_reasons": "Your product was not mentioned because its online content does not explicitly use the term 'marketing attribution software' or detail the specific attribution models it supports (e.g., first-touch, multi-touch, algorithmic). Competitors are being rewarded for this specificity on their product and blog pages.",
      "path_to_inclusion": "Revise your product page and marketing materials to explicitly position Linkrunner as a 'marketing attribution platform.' Create a dedicated 'Features' or 'Models' section that clearly lists the types of attribution models your software provides. Develop authoritative blog content, similar to competitors, that explains different attribution models and positions Linkrunner as a leading solution, particularly for its mobile-focused target market."
