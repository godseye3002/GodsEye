    "title": "Your AEO Competitive Analysis for Linkrunner",
    "status_overview": "Your product was not featured, as the AI currently prioritizes platforms that explicitly promote advanced capabilities like multi-touch attribution, direct CRM integration, and server-side tracking to prove marketing ROI.",
    "strategic_analogy": "This is like entering a professional auto race with a well-built go-kart. While your product is functional and solves a core need (tracking), the competition is being judged on high-performance features like engine horsepower (CRM integration), aerodynamics (multi-touch attribution), and advanced telemetry (AI-powered insights), which are not currently part of your product's public narrative."

  "ai_answer_deconstruction": {
    "dominant_narrative": "The AI is building a narrative that modern growth marketing requires moving beyond simple link tracking to comprehensive analytics solutions that can prove ROI. The 'best' tools are framed as those that connect marketing activities directly to sales revenue through features like multi-touch attribution, deep CRM integration, and accurate, privacy-resilient data collection (e.g., server-side tracking).",

      "Specific, named features (e.g., 'Multi-Touch Attribution Models', 'Server-side tracking', 'CRM Integration')",

    "trusted_source_analysis": "The AI demonstrates high trust in a mix of sources: 1) The official websites of major, well-established platforms (e.g., HubSpot, Google Analytics). 2) The content blogs of specialized, up-and-coming competitors who write authoritatively on the topic (e.g., Cometly, RedTrack). 3) Third-party marketing technology blogs and agency websites that publish 'best of' lists and reviews (e.g., Cleverly.co, AgencyAnalytics.com)."

  "strategic_gap_and_opportunity_analysis": {
    "analysis_summary": "Linkrunner's absence from the AI overviews stems from a language and feature positioning gap. The AI is rewarding platforms that speak the language of advanced marketing analytics—'attribution', 'ROI', and 'CRM integration'—while Linkrunner's current messaging focuses on more foundational tracking of 'clicks, downloads, and onboarding'. Competitors are winning by framing themselves as solutions to a core business problem (proving marketing's value), not just a technical one (tracking links).",
    "if_featured": null,
    "if_not_featured": {
      "exclusion_reasons": "Your product was not mentioned because its public-facing descriptions lack the key terminology and feature sets the AI has identified as critical. Specifically, there is no mention of 'multi-touch attribution models', 'CRM integration', 'server-side tracking', or a direct connection to calculating 'marketing ROI', which are the dominant themes in the AI's recommendations.",
      "path_to_inclusion": "To get featured, you must align your product's narrative with the AI's decision factors. Revise your website and product pages to prominently feature and detail your attribution capabilities. Create dedicated content (e.g., blog posts, landing pages) around topics like 'How to Prove Channel ROI' and 'Multi-Touch Attribution for Growth Marketers'. Securing mentions or reviews on authoritative marketing blogs that compare you favorably against the featured competitors would also build the necessary third-party validation."

    {
      "recommendation": "Keyword and Claim Alignment",
      "action": "Integrate the specific, high-value phrases the AI rewards into your marketing copy. Go beyond 'click tracking' to use terms like 'granular event-based tracking', 'full-funnel attribution', 'connect marketing spend to revenue', and 'multi-touch attribution' to describe your product's value."

    {
      "recommendation": "Third-Party Validation Strategy",
      "action": "Develop an outreach strategy to be included in 'best of' lists and reviews on the marketing tech blogs cited by the AI (e.g., Cleverly.co, AgencyAnalytics, etc.). Create content that directly compares Linkrunner to competitors like Cometly and RedTrack on the features the AI values, aiming to rank for those comparison queries."
