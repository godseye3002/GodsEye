    "title": "Your AEO Competitive Analysis for Linkrunner",
    "status_overview": "Your product was not featured, as the AI categorized solutions by specific channel type (YouTube, Sales, Marketing) and prioritized competitors with dedicated content, such as glossaries or articles, that directly addresses the query's concepts.",
    "strategic_analogy": "This is like showing up to a job interview for a 'Project Manager' role with a resume that only says 'Good at Getting Things Done'. Competitors arrived with resumes tailored for 'Agile Software Project Manager' or 'Construction Project Manager', and the AI hired the specialists."

    "status": "Not Featured",
    "details": "Linkrunner was not mentioned in the AI's overview text or included in its source links."

  "ai_answer_deconstruction": {
    "dominant_narrative": "The AI interprets 'channel performance' in multiple contexts, segmenting its answer into specific tool categories for YouTube creators, sales/partner channel managers, and cross-channel marketers. The narrative is about providing specialized tools for distinct business needs rather than a single general-purpose solution.",
    "key_decision_factors": [
      "Categorization by channel type (YouTube, Sales, Marketing)",
      "Specific features (e.g., SEO, A/B testing, KPI dashboards, scheduling)",
      "Source content directly addressing the query's topic (e.g., articles on 'cross-channel optimization', glossary entries for 'channel performance tools')",
      "Brand authority within a niche"
    ],
    "trusted_source_analysis": "The AI primarily trusts brand-owned content, such as official product pages, blog posts (listicles), and glossary articles that define the concepts related to the query. Each source is a direct domain of a featured product, indicating a reliance on first-party authority."

  "strategic_gap_and_opportunity_analysis": {
    "analysis_summary": "Linkrunner was not featured because the AI structured its answer around distinct, well-defined channel types, and your product's positioning as a tool for 'distribution channels' may be too broad. Competitors won by having specific, targeted content on their own websites that directly matched the AI's categorical interpretation of the query.",

    "if_not_featured": {
      "exclusion_reasons": "Your product was excluded primarily because its online content, as suggested by the provided URL, is focused on being a 'Onelink alternative', which is too niche for this broad query. The AI prioritized competitors whose websites contain content (articles, glossaries) that directly defines or discusses the broader topic of 'channel performance optimization', allowing the AI to categorize them effectively.",
      "path_to_inclusion": "Create dedicated, top-of-funnel content on the Linkrunner blog or in a resources section. A title like 'A Guide to Optimizing Marketing Channel Performance' or 'Top Tools for Tracking Distribution Channel KPIs' would directly address the query. This content should explicitly define the channels Linkrunner supports (e.g., paid social, email, affiliates) and highlight key features like 'KPI dashboards' and 'performance tracking' to align with the AI's selection criteria."

Seek inclusion in existing 'best marketing analytics tools' listicles by reaching out to their authors to build external authority."
