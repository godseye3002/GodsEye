Your product is highly specialized and effective in its niche (MMP/channel tracking), but the AI is judging based on a broader set of criteria (budgeting, FP&A, CRM integration) where larger, multi-event competitors are currently winning."

  "strategic_gap_and_opportunity_analysis": {
    "analysis_summary": "Linkrunner - 2's exclusion stems from a mismatch between its current online messaging, which focuses on its identity as a 'Marketing Measurement Platform (MMP)', and the AI's search for broader 'budget allocation' and 'optimization' platforms. The AI is rewarding platforms that are either explicitly named in trusted third-party listicles or whose websites use the precise language of budget management and multi-channel attribution.",

      "exclusion_reasons": "Your product was not mentioned because its core value proposition, while relevant, is not framed using the key terms the AI has identified as critical, such as 'budget allocation', 'scenario planning', or 'multi-channel attribution modeling'. Furthermore, it is absent from the authoritative third-party review sites that the AI is using as its primary sources of truth for this query.",
      "path_to_inclusion": "The primary path to inclusion is twofold: First, revise your website's content to explicitly incorporate and elaborate on how your features solve for 'marketing budget allocation' and 'attribution modeling'. Second, and most critically, execute a digital PR strategy to secure features and positive reviews on high-authority marketing tech blogs and review sites like G2, ClickUp, and Whatagraph."
