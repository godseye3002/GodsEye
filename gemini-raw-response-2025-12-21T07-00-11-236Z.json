    "analysis_summary": "Linkrunner's absence from the AI overview stems from a disconnect in positioning and a lack of third-party validation. The AI prioritizes established MMPs with broad feature sets mentioned in authoritative industry blogs, a category Linkrunner currently falls outside of in its online presence.",

      "current_positioning": null,

      "exclusion_reasons": "Your product was excluded because the AI's answer is dominated by established 'Mobile Measurement Partners (MMPs)'. Linkrunner is not positioned as an MMP and its feature set appears less comprehensive than the competitors, which are highlighted for advanced capabilities like fraud prevention, deep linking, and multi-touch attribution. Critically, Linkrunner is absent from the third-party industry blogs and 'best of' lists that the AI uses as trusted sources.",
      "path_to_inclusion": "To get featured, you must align your product's language with the AI's rewarded terminology, such as 'MMP alternative' or 'multi-touch attribution'. The most crucial step is to execute a digital PR strategy to secure mentions, reviews, and listings in the same marketing tech blogs (e.g., Segwise, Business of Apps, G2) that the AI is citing for its information on competitors. This external validation is the primary path to inclusion."

    {
      "recommendation": "Keyword and Claim Alignment",
      "action": "Update your website copy to incorporate the specific terminology the AI is rewarding. If applicable, describe your tool as an 'MMP alternative' or a 'mobile attribution tool'. Clearly articulate how you solve for 'ROI and LTV reporting' and 'data consolidation', which were identified as key features for growth marketers in the AI overview."

    {
      "recommendation": "Third-Party Validation Strategy",
      "action": "Launch a targeted outreach campaign to get Linkrunner included in 'Top MMPs' or 'Best Marketing Analytics Tools' articles on authoritative domains like Business of Apps, Segwise, Whatagraph, and G2. Securing placement in these exact or similar source types is the most direct way to influence future AI-generated answers."
