    "title": "Your AEO Competitive Analysis for Avyott Talk",
    "status_overview": "Your product was not featured, as the AI currently prioritizes established, enterprise-grade platforms that showcase quantifiable performance metrics (e.g., '80% automation', '99.8% accuracy') and a broad feature set on their own brand websites.",
    "strategic_analogy": "This is like entering a car race with a brochure about your powerful engine. The winners are on the track, showcasing their lap times, top speeds, and specific features like 'turbochargers' and 'all-wheel drive'. Your product needs to move from describing its potential to proving its performance with hard data."

It showcases solutions that can handle a high volume of tasks across multiple channels, proving their value with specific percentages, accuracy rates, and extensive integration capabilities.",

      "Quantifiable performance claims (e.g., 'automates up to 80%', '99.8% accuracy')",

  "strategic_gap_and_opportunity_analysis": {
    "analysis_summary": "Avyott Talk is currently invisible to the AI for this query because its online messaging is too conceptual and lacks the specific, data-driven proof points the AI is rewarding. Competitors are winning by explicitly stating their performance metrics, named features, and integration capabilities on their websites, which the AI is directly extracting and citing. The opportunity is to translate Avyott Talk's capabilities into this data-first language.",
    "if_featured": null,
    "if_not_featured": {
      "exclusion_reasons": "Your product was excluded because its online content likely lacks the specific, quantifiable metrics (e.g., automation percentage, accuracy rate, number of integrations) that the AI is identifying as key decision factors. Competitors are explicitly stating 'automates 80% of support' or '99.8% accuracy', while your product's description is more general. Furthermore, the AI is rewarding platforms with a broad, named feature set (ticketing, copilots, omnichannel), whereas Avyott Talk is positioned more narrowly as a 'voice' solution.",
      "path_to_inclusion": "Revise your product page to prominently feature a 'Performance & ROI' section with hard data (even if estimated or based on case studies). Create a 'Features' section that details specific functionalities beyond general 'voice automation', such as 'AI-Powered Call Routing' or 'Automated IVR'. Develop content, such as a blog post titled 'Top AI Voice Automation Platforms for Customer Service', to establish authority and control the narrative, similar to Crescendo's successful strategy."

  "actionable_recommendations": [
    {
      "recommendation": "Content Structure Enhancement",
      "action": "On the Avyott Talk product page, create distinct, easily scannable sections using H2/H3 tags for 'Key Performance Metrics', 'Core Features', and 'Integrations'. Use bullet points and bold text to highlight specific numbers and feature names."
    },
    {
      "recommendation": "Keyword and Claim Alignment",
      "action": "Incorporate the exact data-driven phrases the AI is rewarding into your web copy. For example, instead of 'automates complex workflows', use 'Automates up to 75% of inbound customer calls with 99%+ intent accuracy'. Benchmark against competitors and use their language as a guide."
    },
    {
      "recommendation": "Third-Party Validation Strategy",
      "action": "While direct brand sites are currently favored, a long-term strategy should involve getting listed and reviewed on software comparison sites like G2, Capterra, and industry tech blogs. In the short term, create your own authoritative content comparing solutions in your niche to attract AI crawlers and establish thought leadership."
