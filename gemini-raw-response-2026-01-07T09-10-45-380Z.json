  "executive_summary": {
    "title": "Your AEO Competitive Analysis for Linkrunner",
    "status_overview": "Your product was not featured, as the AI currently prioritizes tools explicitly defined as 'multi-touch marketing attribution' platforms, a category your product is not currently positioned within.",
    "strategic_analogy": "This is like bringing a high-performance stopwatch to a chess tournament. While your tool is excellent at measuring speed and individual moves (clicks, downloads), the judges are rewarding tools that can analyze the entire game strategy (the full multi-touch customer journey and conversion credit)."
  },
  "client_product_visibility": {
    "status": "Not Featured",
    "details": "Linkrunner was not mentioned in the AI's overview text or in the list of top tools. The response focused on a different sub-category of marketing software centered on comprehensive attribution modeling."
  },
  "ai_answer_deconstruction": {
    "dominant_narrative": "The AI is building a narrative around advanced, data-driven solutions that go beyond simple analytics to assign credit for conversions across a complex customer journey. It emphasizes AI/ML capabilities, a variety of sophisticated attribution models (Markov, Shapley), and the ability to track users across multiple channels and devices.",
    "key_decision_factors": [
      "Explicit use of terms like 'Multi-Touch Attribution' and 'Data-driven models'",
      "Mention of specific attribution models (e.g., Markov chains, Shapley values, linear, time-decay)",
      "Highlighting AI and Machine Learning (ML) capabilities for optimization",
      "Integration with other platforms like CRMs (e.g., Salesforce)",
      "Source authority from tool providers' own blog posts that compare market options"
    ],
    "trusted_source_analysis": "The AI demonstrates high trust in content marketing from the tool providers themselves. It cites blog posts from competitors (Growify, Factors, Ruler Analytics) that compare and list various marketing attribution tools, effectively using the competitors' own content to build its answer."

  "strategic_gap_and_opportunity_analysis": {
    "analysis_summary": "The core issue is a mismatch in product categorization. Linkrunner is positioned as a 'Link Tracking and Analytics Tool,' while the AI's answer is exclusively focused on 'Marketing Attribution Platforms.' The AI is rewarding competitors who use the specific language of attribution (e.g., multi-touch, conversion credit, attribution models), which is absent from your product's current description. Your product solves a related but narrower problem than what the AI is addressing for this query.",
    "if_featured": null,
    "if_not_featured": {
      "exclusion_reasons": "Your product was excluded because its core positioning as a 'Link Tracking' tool does not align with the AI's definition of an 'Advanced Marketing Attribution' tool. Competitors are winning by explicitly marketing themselves with terms like 'multi-touch attribution,' 'predictive revenue modeling,' and specific attribution models (Markov, Shapley), which are the key decision factors the AI has identified.",
      "path_to_inclusion": "Create targeted landing pages and blog content that frame Linkrunner's capabilities within the context of marketing attribution. A blog post titled 'The Top 5 Marketing Attribution Tools for Growth Marketers' that includes Linkrunner could be effective. This content should explicitly use keywords like 'multi-touch attribution,' 'channel ROI,' and 'conversion path analysis' to align with the AI's selection criteria. Pursuing inclusion in third-party roundup articles, similar to the ones cited by the AI, is also critical."
