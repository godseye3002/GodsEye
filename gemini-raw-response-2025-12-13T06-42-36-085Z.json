Your product is positioned as a 'link tracking tool', while the AI is answering a query for the broader, more complex 'MMP platform' category.

      "exclusion_reasons": "Your product was excluded because its current online positioning as a 'Link Tracking and Analytics Tool' does not match the AI's focus on the 'Mobile Measurement Partner (MMP)' category. Competitors are winning because they are explicitly identified as MMPs and their content highlights comprehensive features like fraud prevention, deep linking, and privacy compliance, which are absent from your product's provided description.",
      "path_to_inclusion": "To gain inclusion, reposition Linkrunner as a competitive MMP. Update your website and marketing materials to use 'MMP' terminology. Create detailed content (landing pages, blog posts) that showcases how Linkrunner addresses the key features the AI values: attribution models, fraud detection, deep linking, and integrations. The most critical step is to pursue features and reviews on the authoritative tech blogs cited by the AI (e.g., Segwise, Business of Apps) to build third-party validation."
