    "title": "Your AEO Competitive Analysis for Linkrunner - 2",
    "status_overview": "Your product was not featured, as the AI prioritizes competitors with clearly defined specializations (e.g., eCommerce, mobile), transparent pricing, and mentions on authoritative third-party review websites.",
    "strategic_analogy": "This is like entering a car show where every winning vehicle has its specs—horsepower, 0-60 time, price—clearly displayed. Your product is in the parking lot without a spec sheet, making it invisible to the judges who are looking for specific, comparable data points."

    "analysis_summary": "Linkrunner - 2 is not visible because its online messaging lacks the specificity and data points the AI engine is actively seeking. The AI prioritizes products that clearly state their niche, features, and pricing, and are validated by third-party sources. Linkrunner's current description is too general to compete against the highly specialized and transparent positioning of its competitors.",
    "if_featured": null,
    "if_not_featured": {
      "exclusion_reasons": "The primary reasons for exclusion are: 1) Lack of a clearly defined niche (unlike competitors focusing on 'eCommerce' or 'mobile'). 2) Absence of public pricing information, a key data point the AI extracts. 3) Vague feature descriptions ('AI-Driven Insights') compared to competitors' specific claims ('SKAdNetwork support', '7 attribution models'). 4) No presence in the authoritative third-party review sites the AI uses as trusted sources.",
      "path_to_inclusion": "To get featured, focus on two fronts: 1) On-Page: Revise your product page to explicitly state target markets, list specific, tangible features (e.g., 'multi-touch attribution models', 'LTV analysis'), and add a pricing page or section. 2) Off-Page: Prioritize getting Linkrunner - 2 reviewed and listed on software comparison sites like SMBGuide or featured in industry blogs similar to RulerAnalytics."

      "action": "Launch a targeted outreach campaign to be included in 'best marketing attribution software' listicles on sites like G2, Capterra, and industry blogs like the ones cited by the AI (smbguide.com, ruleranalytics.com). This external validation is a critical ranking factor."
