    "title": "Your AEO Competitive Analysis for Linkrunner",
    "status_overview": "Your product was not featured, as the AI currently prioritizes competitors that are mentioned in third-party roundup articles and clearly articulate a broad range of specific, technical features like A/B testing, bot filtering, and API support.",
    "strategic_analogy": "This is like entering a car show where the judges are rewarding vehicles based on detailed spec sheets. While your car is excellent, your brochure only says 'drives fast,' while competitors are listing '0-60 in 2.8s,' 'carbon-ceramic brakes,' and 'active aerodynamics.' The AI is rewarding specificity and third-party validation, which are currently missing from your positioning."

The story is about choice based on technical needs and user persona.",
    "key_decision_factors": [
      "Specific, named features (e.g., A/B testing, fraud detection, retargeting pixels, API support)",
      "Target user segmentation (e.g., developers, marketers)",
      "Business model differentiators (e.g., open-source, free tier, self-hosting)",
      "Source authority (mentions in third-party 'best of' listicles)",
      "Clear pricing tiers (e.g., free limits, paid plans)"
    ],
    "trusted_source_analysis": "The AI demonstrates high trust in third-party content sites that publish comparative roundups and listicles (e.g., knock.app, scaleo.io). It also directly cites a brand's own website (linklyhq.com) when it effectively communicates its features and value proposition."

  "strategic_gap_and_opportunity_analysis": {
    "analysis_summary": "Linkrunner's absence from the AI response stems from a combination of overly niche positioning and a lack of specific, marketable feature callouts in its online content. The AI's selections are heavily influenced by third-party listicles that review and compare a wide array of tools. To be included, Linkrunner must broaden its appeal beyond being a 'Onelink alternative' and get featured in these key third-party sources.",
    "if_featured": null,
    "if_not_featured": {
      "exclusion_reasons": "Your product was excluded because its online content, as reflected in the provided data, does not explicitly list the specific, technical features (e.g., 'A/B testing', 'bot filtering', 'geo-redirects') that the AI is rewarding. Furthermore, your product is not mentioned in the authoritative third-party roundup articles that the AI is using as primary sources to build its answer.",
      "path_to_inclusion": "Revise your product pages to include a detailed 'Features' section with bullet points that explicitly name your capabilities using industry-standard terms. Broaden your marketing copy to appeal to the general 'link tracking analytics' query. Most importantly, execute a digital PR and content strategy to get Linkrunner reviewed or included in 'best link tracking tool' articles on authoritative marketing and developer blogs."

Use bullet points to list specific features, making the information easily parsable for AI crawlers."

    {
      "recommendation": "Keyword and Claim Alignment",
      "action": "If your product has them, ensure your web copy prominently features the exact keywords and features the AI has rewarded competitors for, such as 'A/B testing', 'real-time analytics', 'retargeting pixels', 'geo-targeting', and 'fraud detection'."

    {
      "recommendation": "Third-Party Validation Strategy",
      "action": "Identify and target marketing and developer blogs (similar to knock.app and scaleo.io) for product reviews, comparisons, and inclusion in listicles. Securing mentions on these trusted, third-party domains is critical for building the source authority the AI is looking for."
