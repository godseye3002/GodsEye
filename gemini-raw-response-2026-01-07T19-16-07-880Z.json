    "title": "Your AEO Competitive Analysis for Linkrunner",
    "status_overview": "Your product was not featured, as the AI currently prioritizes tools mentioned in authoritative third-party listicles and those with clearly articulated, specific features like A/B testing, funnel analysis, and generous free plans.",
    "strategic_analogy": "This is like trying to get into an exclusive club. The bouncers (the AI) are checking a guest list compiled from trusted sources (tech blogs and competitor content). To get in, you need to either get your name on that list or become a trusted source yourself."

    "dominant_narrative": "The AI is constructing a portfolio of solutions for growth marketers, segmenting tools by their core strength: a foundational industry standard (GA4), a specialized behavioral analytics tool (Mixpanel), a performance/affiliate marketing powerhouse (ClickMagick), a value-driven option with a strong free tier (ShortPen), and a brand-centric tool (Rebrandly). The narrative emphasizes that the 'best' tool depends on the marketer's specific need.",

      "Integration with other platforms (e.g., Google Ads, CRM)",
      "Source authority from tech blogs and product listicles"
    ],
    "trusted_source_analysis": "The AI heavily trusts third-party content sites publishing 'best of' listicles (e.g., redtrack.io, knock.app, whatagraph.com). It also gives significant weight to direct brand domains (rebrandly.com, shortpen.com) that publish similar comparative content, effectively using content marketing to establish authority."

  "strategic_gap_and_opportunity_analysis": {
    "analysis_summary": "Linkrunner was not featured despite its relevant market positioning. The primary gap is a lack of external validation from authoritative third-party sources that the AI is citing, and an opportunity exists to better articulate its specific, advanced features to match the granularity rewarded in competitor descriptions.",
    "if_featured": null,
    "if_not_featured": {
      "exclusion_reasons": "The product was excluded because it lacks mentions in the types of third-party 'best of' listicles the AI relies on for recommendations. Furthermore, competitors are being rewarded for promoting highly specific features (e.g., 'anti-fraud', 'funnel analysis') and clear value propositions (e.g., 'generous free plan'), while Linkrunner's listed features are more general.",
      "path_to_inclusion": "1. Launch a content marketing strategy on linkrunner.io to create authoritative 'best of' listicles that include your product. 2. Refine product marketing copy to explicitly highlight unique, granular features beyond 'performance tracking', such as 'channel-specific A/B testing' or 'automated onboarding funnel analysis'. 3. Execute a digital PR campaign to secure mentions and reviews on high-authority marketing tech blogs and software review sites."
