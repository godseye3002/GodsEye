    "title": "Your AEO Competitive Analysis for Linkrunner",
    "status_overview": "Your product was not featured, as the AI currently prioritizes established analytics platforms with clearly defined use cases (e.g., behavioral analytics, crash reporting) that are mentioned on authoritative third-party tech blogs.",
    "strategic_analogy": "This is like trying to join a conversation about the best cars, where everyone is discussing sedans and SUVs. Your product, a high-performance motorcycle (MMP), is highly relevant to transportation but isn't being included because the discussion is framed around a different category of vehicles. You need to reframe your product in their terms or find a source that introduces motorcycles into the conversation."

  "ai_answer_deconstruction": {
    "dominant_narrative": "The AI is building a narrative that guides users to select a mobile marketing analytics platform based on their app's maturity and specific needs. It positions Firebase as the ideal, free starting point, with Amplitude and Mixpanel as advanced, paid options for deep behavioral insights, and data.ai for market intelligence.",
    "key_decision_factors": [
      "Specific use cases (e.g., behavioral analytics, crash reporting, funnel optimization)",
      "Target company stage (e.g., startups, growth-stage)",

      "Ecosystem integration (e.g., Google's ecosystem)",
      "Clear product categorization (e.g., General Analytics, Behavioral Analytics, Market Intelligence)"
    ],
    "trusted_source_analysis": "The AI exclusively trusts third-party B2B tech and marketing blogs (improvado.io, thecmo.com, preapps.com) that publish 'best of' lists and tool comparisons. It is not citing any direct brand websites for its primary claims."

  "strategic_gap_and_opportunity_analysis": {
    "analysis_summary": "The primary reason for Linkrunner's exclusion is its absence from the high-authority third-party comparison articles that form the basis of the AI's answer. Additionally, its product positioning as an 'MMP' focusing on 'distribution channels' does not perfectly align with the established categories of 'behavioral analytics' or 'product analytics' that the AI is currently rewarding.",
    "if_featured": null,
    "if_not_featured": {
      "exclusion_reasons": "Your product was excluded because the AI's answer is built from third-party 'best of' lists where Linkrunner is not present. Furthermore, the AI prioritizes platforms with clearly defined feature sets like 'behavioral analytics' or 'crash reporting', while your product's positioning as an 'AI-driven MMP' and 'distribution channel tracker' doesn't align with the categories the AI has established for this query.",
      "path_to_inclusion": "The most direct path to inclusion is securing mentions and positive reviews on authoritative B2B marketing and tech blogs like those cited (Improvado, The CMO). Additionally, refine your website's copy to include and elaborate on keywords the AI rewards, such as 'event tracking,' 'user journey analysis,' and 'user acquisition,' to better align with the established narrative."

  "actionable_recommendations": [
    {
      "recommendation": "Content Structure Enhancement",
      "action": "On your primary product page, implement a clear, scannable structure using H2/H3 tags for 'Key Features', 'Use Cases', and 'Integrations'. Use bullet points to list specific tracking capabilities (e.g., 'Granular Event Tracking: Clicks, Downloads, Onboardings'), making the information easily parsable for AI crawlers."
    },
    {
      "recommendation": "Keyword and Claim Alignment",
      "action": "Incorporate terms like 'event-based tracking', 'user journey analysis', 'retention analysis', and 'user acquisition' into your product descriptions to match the language the AI is rewarding in competitors. Frame your 'distribution channel tracking' as a solution for 'marketing attribution and user acquisition'."
    },
    {
      "recommendation": "Third-Party Validation Strategy",
      "action": "Launch a targeted outreach campaign to be included in 'best marketing analytics tools' or 'top mobile measurement partner' articles on high-authority domains like Improvado, The CMO, G2, or Capterra, as the AI relies exclusively on these types of sources for its recommendations."
